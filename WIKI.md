## 🎯 What is MindGraph?

**MindGraph** is an intelligent data visualization platform that automatically generates interactive charts and graphs from natural language descriptions. Powered by AI and D3.js, it transforms your ideas into beautiful, interactive visualizations in seconds.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Uses AI to understand your requests and generate appropriate chart types
- **🧠 Educational Focus**: Specializes in Thinking Maps® and educational diagram generation
- **📊 Multiple Chart Types**: Supports Thinking Maps® (Bubble Maps, Circle Maps, Double Bubble Maps, Bridge Maps), concept maps, mind maps, and traditional charts
- **🌐 Interactive**: Fully interactive D3.js visualizations with hover effects, animations, and zoom
- **🎨 Beautiful Design**: Modern, responsive UI with customizable themes
- **📱 Export Options**: Export charts as PNG images or interactive HTML
- **🌍 Multi-language**: Supports both English and Chinese
- **⚡ Real-time**: Instant chart generation with live preview

### 🆕 What's New in Version 2.3.1

- **🔧 Enhanced Bridge Maps**: Improved visual clarity with cleaner presentation
- **🎯 Better User Experience**: Enhanced interface and performance
- **⚡ Automatic Setup**: No manual configuration required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for D3.js components)
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lycosa9527/MindGraph.git
   cd MindGraph
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:9527/debug` to access the web interface.

## 🎨 How It Works

### 1. Natural Language Input
Simply describe what you want to visualize:
- "Compare cats and dogs"
- "Define artificial intelligence"
- "Show the relationship between cause and effect"
- "Create a mind map about climate change"

### 2. AI Analysis
The AI:
- Analyzes your request
- Determines the best chart type
- Extracts relevant data characteristics
- Generates appropriate sample data

### 3. Chart Generation
D3.js creates an interactive visualization with:
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations
- Interactive tooltips
- Zoom and pan capabilities

### 4. Export & Share
Export your charts as:
- Interactive HTML files
- High-resolution PNG images

## 📊 Supported Chart Types

### 🧠 Thinking Maps® (Educational Diagrams)

| Chart Type | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Bubble Map** | Central topic with connected attributes | Describing characteristics of a single topic |
| **Circle Map** | Outer boundary with central topic and perimeter context | Defining topics in context |
| **Double Bubble Map** | Two topics with shared and unique characteristics | Comparing and contrasting two topics |
| **Bridge Map** | Analogical relationships with relating factors | Showing analogies and similarities |

### 📈 Traditional Charts

| Chart Type | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Bar Chart** | Vertical or horizontal bars | Comparing categories |
| **Line Chart** | Connected data points | Trends over time |
| **Pie Chart** | Circular segments | Proportions and percentages |
| **Scatter Plot** | Points on X-Y axes | Correlations and distributions |
| **Area Chart** | Filled areas under lines | Cumulative data over time |
| **Heatmap** | Color-coded grid | Matrix data visualization |
| **Tree Map** | Nested rectangles | Hierarchical data |
| **Network Graph** | Connected nodes | Relationships and connections |

## 🎨 Example Prompts

Try these prompts to get started:

- "Compare cats and dogs"
- "Define artificial intelligence"
- "Show the relationship between cause and effect"
- "Create a mind map about climate change"

    "prompt": "Compare cats and dogs",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

### Export as PNG

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9527/generate_png \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Show monthly revenue trends",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Charts not rendering properly?**
A: Ensure Playwright is installed: `python -m playwright install chromium`

**Q: API requests failing?**
A: Check your API key in the `.env` file and ensure the service is running

**Q: Slow chart generation?**
A: This is normal for complex charts. Consider using the async API for better performance

**Q: Export not working?**
A: Verify that the export directory has write permissions
